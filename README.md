Discrete element method simulations data format specification.

The DEMDF project aims to stablish an standard for configuration files for particle simulations.
The goal of the DEMDF project is to decouple the data handling/simulation specification from the
integration, specific to the many DEM implementations now available.
Furthermore, the standarization of the configuration files could make it easier to share
data analysis routines.
