    "description": "The following document describes the Discrete Element Method File Format (DEMDF), a common file format for particle simulations. DEMDF is built upon the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data-interchange format; we refer the readers to [http://json.org/](http://json.org/) for the JSON data format specification. The JSON data format is used mainly due to its minimal formating and thus excellent human readibility, and due to the widespread availability of parsers in many programming lenguages.\n\nDEMDF specifies the name, data types, uses and limits of common variables to all Discrete Element Method simulations. Its goals are flexibility, that is, the ability to be used by most types of particle simulations; low size, by reducing as much as possible repeated data; and readability.",
